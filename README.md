A Python tool to manage and organize Booth item assets. This package lets you import items by reading a CSV (with "URL" or "ID" columns), JSON, or plain text file containing Booth item links or IDs. For each item, the tool:

- Creates a dedicated folder under the `BoothItems` directory.
- Scrapes metadata (title, description, item ID, image URLs, etc.) from the Booth page.
- Downloads images into an `images` subfolder.
- Updates a central CSV database (`database.csv`) with the item metadata and local folder paths.

It also supports removing items from the database (with an option to delete their folders).

## Features

- **Flexible Input:**  
  Accepts CSV, JSON, or plain text files.  
  - **CSV:** Supports columns "URL" or "ID" (case-insensitive) plus an optional "Title".
  - **JSON:** Expects a list of objects with keys "url" or "id" (case-insensitive) and optionally "title".
  - **Plain Text:** One URL or item ID per line.

- **Automatic Metadata Scraping:**  
  Scrapes key metadata from Booth pages, including title, item ID, description, and image URLs.

- **Image Capture & Download:**  
  Downloads images found on the item page into an `images` subfolder within the item's folder. Local paths are recorded in the metadata.

- **Folder Organization:**  
  Creates a dedicated folder for each item (named using the item ID and a sanitized title) under the `BoothItems` directory.

- **Centralized Database:**  
  Maintains a CSV database (`database.csv`) that stores metadata for all managed items.

- **Import & Remove Operations:**  
  Easily import new items or remove items (with optional folder deletion) via simple input files.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Required Packages:**  
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`

These are automatically installed when you install the package.

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chazmaniandinkle/booth-assets-manager.git
   cd booth-assets-manager
   ```

2. **Install the Package**
   You can install the package in editable mode (for development) with pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   Alternatively, build and install using:

   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   pip install dist/booth_assets_manager-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

---

## Usage

Once installed, the tool provides a command-line script named `booth-assets-manager`.

### Importing Items

To import items from an input file and update your local database, run:

```bash
booth-assets-manager input_file [--force]
```

- `input_file`: Path to your CSV, JSON, or plain text file.
- `--force`: Optional flag to force re-download of metadata and images even if already present.

Example:

```bash
booth-assets-manager my_items.csv --force
```

### Removing Items

To remove items from your database (and optionally delete their folders), run:

```bash
booth-assets-manager input_file --remove [--delete-folders]
```

- `input_file`: Path to your CSV, JSON, or plain text file listing items to remove.
- `--delete-folders`: Optional flag to also delete the associated item folders from disk.

Example:

```bash
booth-assets-manager remove_items.txt --remove --delete-folders
```

---

## Input File Formats

### CSV Files

The CSV file can contain columns named "URL" or "ID" (case-insensitive), with an optional "Title" column.

Example (items.csv):
```csv
URL,Title
https://booth.pm/items/123456789,Stylish Outfit
https://booth.pm/items/987654321,Cool Jacket
```

Or using IDs:
```csv
ID,Title
123456789,Stylish Outfit
987654321,Cool Jacket
```

### JSON Files

A JSON file should contain a list of objects. Each object can have keys "url" or "id" (case-insensitive) and optionally "title."

Example (items.json):
```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://booth.pm/items/123456789",
    "title": "Stylish Outfit"
  },
  {
    "id": "987654321",
    "title": "Cool Jacket"
  }
]
```

### Plain Text Files

A plain text file should list one item per line. Each line can be either a full URL (starting with "http") or an item ID.

Example (items.txt):
```
https://booth.pm/items/123456789
987654321
```

## Database

The tool maintains a database file (`database.csv`) that stores metadata for all managed items. Each row includes fields such as:
- item_id
- title
- url
- description
- images (list of original image URLs)
- local_images (paths to downloaded images)
- folder (local folder path)

This database is automatically updated during import and removal operations.

---

## How It Works

1. **Input Parsing:**
   The tool reads your input file, automatically determining whether each entry is a URL or an ID. For CSV and JSON files, keys are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive processing.

2. **Folder Creation & Metadata Scraping:**
   For each item, a dedicated folder is created under `BoothItems/` using a combination of the item ID and a sanitized title.
   - If the metadata.json file is missing or the --force flag is used, the tool scrapes the item's metadata from Booth.
   - The scraper extracts the title, description, and image URLs from the page.

3. **Image Capture & Download:**
   The tool downloads all images found on the item page into an `images` subfolder within the item's folder, recording local paths under "local_images" in the metadata.

4. **Database Update:**
   The collected metadata (with folder and image details) is stored or updated in the central `database.csv` file.

5. **Removal Mode:**
   When run with the --remove flag, the tool removes matching items from the database and, if specified, deletes their associated folders.

## Extending the Script

Future enhancements might include:
- Downloading zip files for purchased items.
- Integrating authentication to automatically process items from your Booth account.
- Enhanced metadata extraction (e.g., additional tags or compatibility information).

Feel free to modify or extend the code to suit your workflow.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Metadata Scraping Errors:**
  If metadata isn't being scraped correctly, verify that the CSS selectors in `organizer.py` (inside `scrape_metadata()`) match Booth's current page structure.

- **Input Parsing Issues:**
  Ensure your input file is formatted correctly. For CSV and JSON files, use the proper keys ("url" or "id")â€”these are handled case-insensitively.

- **Image Download Errors:**
  Check your internet connection if image downloads fail, and review output messages for specific error details.

- **Network Errors:**
  Verify your internet connection if the tool fails to retrieve pages.
